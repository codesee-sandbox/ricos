If you are lost and trying to get to the bird walk, call Deborah's cell phone...but remember on weekends there will be 2-3 other people calling who are also lost - please be patient. If in doubt about whether a walk will take place or not the morning of the walk: check the main landing page of this web site as well as the \"Schedule\" page - if the walk is cancelled, information will be posted there by 6am the day of the walk, and usually by 11pm the night before. If still confused and as a last resort, call us at home - if no one answers it means we left for the bird walk. We end all our Central Park walks (except Fridays) at the Boathouse at about noon; you can get a cup of coffee and a muffin there (around $6 total). Walks last about 3 hrs (less if hot or rainy), and you can leave at anytime - we won't be offended. If you need directions/help to your next destination, just ask someone on the walk - we are a helpful group.",

He ran along rough, cemented rocks that form the foundation for the wall at the back of the park's police station at the Eighty-sixth Street transverse. Billy could have been the cat in the \"Tom Cat\" California citrus advertisements of yesteryear: cold green eyes, wire-whiskers and big, rounded white patches on a glossy black coat. He had a house sparrow, still alive, in his mouth. Billy was the first feral cat I had seen in the park and I thought it was just a matter of time before he, like the other park cats, would be caught in one of the cat-catcher's traps, to be offered for adoption. At best to be sentenced to life in a New York apartment, at worst to be put down-whichever way you wanted to look at it. Billy (I still do not know why I gave him that name) had been surprised before he could kill and devour his catch, and he ran hard along the stone wall until it merged with the red brick above it, forcing him to jump two feet to the ground, and forcing a squeal from the spar­ row. Billy stopped to glance back and when he realized I had also stopped to look at him, he broke into a loping cheetah run, crossing a patch of open space near the baseball diamonds at the top end of the Great Lawn. Gripping the sparrow harder, he vanished between a clump of pine trees.",

              "text": "The first of February (1982) brought a newcomer to the reservoir, an unusual duck for the park, a gadwall. A bird of fresh­ water marshes, a dabbler who likes to hide in reeds, this gadwall must have been another victim of the \"Siberian Express.\" The ice on the reservoir had now broken into drifts, exposing a large lake about one hundred yards long at the top end. The gadwall had arrived out of a blue sky during the mid-afternoon, and he joined two lesser scaups and a female ring-necked duck. The gadwall, mixing mottled gray and brown in its silky plumage, climbed from the water and promptly went to sleep on the ice alongside two mallards. Then the sound of a backfiring automobile spooked the mallards, and they shot into the air. The gad­ wall, smaller and lighter on the wing, went with them. The trio rose high to the east, making for the East River.During the first week of February more gulls came to the park than at any other time in the year. There must have been three thousand gulls each morning on the ice, screaming and mewing and causing a general commotion. One morning, seeing the gray ice turned white with gulls, a jog­ger shouted to me as he passed, \"It looks like an all-time convention. . . ,\" his words streaming behind him in freezing breath. I knew somewhere among this number must be an Iceland gull or a whole Hock of them, and maybe even the glaucous gull. The cold, however, drove me home each morning after I could study only a fraction of the gulls' number. I gave the park a miss for a week in early February, trying to cure winter influenza and my obsession with seeing an Iceland gull. Clearing the mailbox for the first time in days I found a letter from Lambert. It was the first he had sent me, and I regarded the letter as a token of strengthening friendship. In it was a carefully drawn pen and ink sketch of a winter finch, a redpoll, he had found in the park.",

I worked the birch trees for a distance of about ten blocks directly opposite the American Museum of Natural History, and I found three redpolls in a European silver birch near the open air Delacorte Theater. The redpoll breeds in northern Canada and comes south to feed, mainly pecking at the hanging seedpods of birches. The female tends to be a dull finch, but in this threesome was a fine male: red crown, black chin and pinkish breast. The birds leaped from branch to branch, clinging upside down at times to reach the tassels containing the seeds. I was fortunate to find the redpolls and I thought my luck might be in for an Iceland gull. It had been an oyster gray day and the light was dying quickly. But a fiery, orange sun surprised its way through clustered shells of clouds, giving me time to reach the reservoir while the light was still good. A bird watcher I had not met before announced triumphantly that he had seen a good specimen of an adult Ice­ land gull. \"It moved about ten minutes ago,\" he said with a smile.",

Then the line stopped at the spot where the redpolls had been seen in previous days. \"First time redpolls found in the park in four years,\" shouted Lambert but the birders without binoculars could not possibly see the four-inch-long finches in the tops of the birches. North went the birders and the concertina expanded and contracted here and there, emitting \"oohs\" and \"ahs\" as the more spectacular birds were seen; a cardinal here, a blue jay there. By the time the reservoir was reached, about a mile and a half from the walk's starting point, the concertina had shrunk considerably. And halfway around the reservoir it was only a third of its original length. Strangely, it was the people without binoculars who were remaining and I surmised it was Sarah's antics that kept them going on the bitterly cold day. Lambert, with a missionary zeal to promote the wonders of birds, was trying desperately to kindle interest among the uninitiated, but the reservoir proved a disappointment. We saw only a lone scaup and a batch of mallards, and we heard Lambert's accounts of the thrill of rarities like the tufted duck all the way from Europe, and the magic of the Iceland gull: \"It's got snow-white mystique, it's the essence of. . . .\" The arrival of a canvasback stopped Lambert in mid-sentence. The duck hit the water clumsily, completely immersing itself for a second in the splash, rising, shaking its head. The bird sailed uneasily for the edge of the ice and with a desperate leap, summoning all the strength it had, the drake hauled himself clear of the water and left a smudge of oil on the ice. The whole of the bird's white underbody was coated in black oil and the drake tugged at his feathers, trying to preen itself.",

It swung its head about slowly and  two schoolboys, seeing the bird in trouble, walked to it across the solid ice that covered the Pond from shore to shore. The gull peered at them, reluctant to fly, but as they cautiously approached, the bird launched into the air in panic.  Its right wing had been ripped off at the wrist, the joint where primary wing feathers begin. With one sound wing and half a wing flapping wildly, the bird swung around in circles. It appeared the gull had been attacked by a dog and the crows were impatient for it to die. After about fifteen minutes one of the flock took off on broad, black wings and flew over the gull, settling on the ice about forty feet away from it. The gull fixed the crow with beady eye, pulling back its head to raise a stout but sharp-tipped bill. The crow, however, had time on its side. ",

But instead of finding a bird of the far north among the thousand or so gulls taking their siesta and afternoon bath at the reservoir, I found a young black-­backed [gull] shaking his head wildly. Stuck in this throat, and wrapped around his beak and head, was what appeared to be the plastic holder for a six-pack of beer. The plastic ensnarling the gull was part of the flotsam of winter piling up on the ice or in the water: a shattered green wine bottle spreading glass across the dirty ice, beer cans, broken, beer bottles, a black umbrella turned inside out, a school book -­ items that had been thrown or blown across the high fence. The gull was dead a few days later and the crows arrived first to pick at the carcass.",

The horse, steaming, came closer, and I noticed the bay and its rider were being watched by a silent, lonely figure I had often seen in the park. His head hidden in the hood of an anorak, the lone man stood under a pin oak on the west side in the Eighties, where he always stood. Sometimes the man had a home movie camera, sometimes not; sometimes he filmed, but I never determined precisely what he was filming. No camera on this cold and gray day. He just watched the steaming horse as it pulled toward the warmth of the stables just off the park.",

An early morning silver sun brought temperatures to a high of fifty-seven degrees and the thawing ground released aromas of compost and humus: rich, sickly and sweet. There was another big concentration of gulls on the reservoir's ice and for a split second, in the blink of an eye, I thought I had seen the Iceland gull, a ghostly white shape among the grays and blacks of the other gulls. Before I could really study it, the bird vanished among the bickering, the preening and wallowing; a snowflake vanishing in a warm palm. I started to worry that my imagination might be running away with me. I had wanted to see this ethereal bird so much I may have been succumbing to fantasy. But it was an Iceland gull I had seen. I watched for another two hours, gave up, was heading out of the park, and then turned back for just one more look. In the long, central channel of open water between the ice floes I finally caught up with the bird. If I were an expert I could report that she -- I like to think of the bird as female -- was one of two subspecies that nests either in northeast Canada, or in Greenland. I could not determine the degree of gray in her wing­tips that would identify her origin, as I watched her frolic in the water, pulling  clear and then dunking her head again. She stretched lanky wings, shaking off droplets of water, and then flew away to join a group of herring gulls.",

Because time for breeding is so short in the north-central United States and Canada, canvasbacks must court and pair in late winter so they can begin mating as soon as they arrive at their breeding grounds. The male scaups were soon to start wooing, too. But one bird would not make it north. Toward the end of February I saw the remains of a dead scaup, coated in oil, being buffeted against the wall of the reservoir.",

Extensive tree-cutting had been ordered by the Central Park administration as part of a wider program to introduce more light to the Ramble's glades and to create vistas incorporated in the original, 125 year-old plan for the park. After the trees had been felled it was possible to observe two landmarks, Bethesda Fountain and the Belvedere Castle, from any position on a straight line between them. But many of the park users were not impressed. In the spring a petition protesting the tree-cutting would gather three thousand signatures. Sheared trunks and amputated tree limbs formed the backdrop for a conflict between tree lovers and the New York Parks Department that dragged on for most of the year.",
